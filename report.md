Each member worked on a feature and a test for that feature, so Vincent Nguyen fixed items.py and added test_items.py, Kevin Ferry fixed ghost.py and added test_ghost.py, Caden Simpson fixed pacman.py and added test_player.py, Meherzan Gai fixed game_board.py and added test_game_board.py. Caden created a GroupMe so we could communicate, and he forked the repository and shared to the rest of the group. Each member also did a pull request and approved one as well, and we found some bugs but decided to report Caden's.
